# Transitions Exercise
In this exercise you will have to work with transitions to get different cool effects on this web. The first step will be to download this repo and take a look at the code and the result of this code.

Once you understand it, we can start working in it. We want to get at least 3 different effects:

You can choose the `transition-duration`, `transition-timing-function` and `transition-delay` that better suits to each case. 
That's up to you!

#### 1 Menu color
When the mouse is over any menu option, it will have to change the color

#### 2 Image zoom in
Ok, not so simple but much cooler. When the mouse is over the image it will display a zoom effect. 
You have a working example in this page:

You will have to use (obviously apart from transition) the `transform` and `overflow` css properties

#### 3 Show text at the end
At the end there is a paragraph with information. But it is not visible, let's solve it.

Change the value of the `visible` and `opacity` property to show the information when the mouse is hover the title with a transition effect

#### 4 (Optional) have you finished and you are bored?
Include in the web an amazing animation!
